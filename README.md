# Web Data Scrapers

## Overview
This project aims to collect information from social media platforms using web scrapers. The following scrapers have been selected for this purpose:

-Selenium
-Puppeteer
-Scrapy

The information to be scraped from each platform is as follows:

## Twitter
-User ID
-Tweet content
-Comments
-Likes count
-Retweet count
-Hyperlinks (@..)
-Hashtags

## Facebook
-User ID
-Post content
-Likes count
-Shares
-Hyperlink (@..)
-Hashtags

## Reddit
-Titles
-Timestamps
-Comments
-Number of upvotes


We will crawl through these social media platforms using these scrapers, along with extended support from the website's search functionality. This allows us to collect a large amount of information and apply methods from recent research to implement efficient scraping solutions.
